# NoteApp
A Note Android Application that I created based off of Mitch Tabian's Tutorial on SQL Databases. This is version 1.0.

Application opens up to this window.

You can like the note, which saves the notes to the favourites tab. 
There is a navigation bar in the top left which contains the total notes tab and the favourites notes tab.

You can title the note and type the contents in the large text box. 
The date of the note is below the large text box.

When you favourite the note, a toast message notifies the user that they have favourited the note

Once you have finished typing your note out, click the green floating action button to save. The title text and text in the box is cleared.
